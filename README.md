#TDS_P2: Data Analysis Automation
*Repository Overview
This repository is part of IITM's Data Science TDS Project-02. It contains the script autolysis.py, which automates basic dataset analysis, visualization, and storytelling for numerical columns. The script identifies the two most variable numerical columns, plots histograms, and generates a correlation heatmap.


#Purpose of the Outputs
The script generates visual outputs to aid data understanding. The results are organized into respective directories:

*goodreads/:

Outputs related to the Goodreads dataset.
Contains:
Top 2 Variable Histograms: Visualizes the distribution of the two most variable numerical columns.
Correlation Heatmap: Displays relationships between all numerical columns.
*happiness/:

Outputs for the Happiness dataset.
Contains the same set of histograms and heatmaps, highlighting key variables and correlations.
*media/:

Outputs for the Media dataset.
Visualizations focus on identifying patterns in the top numerical variables.
