# TDS_P2: Data Analysis Automation

## Repository Overview

This repository is part of IIT Madras's Data Science TDS Project-02. It contains the script `autolysis.py`, which automates basic dataset analysis, visualization, and storytelling for numerical columns. The script identifies the two most variable numerical columns, plots histograms, and generates a correlation heatmap to aid in understanding the data.

## Purpose of the Outputs

The script generates visual outputs to help with data analysis and insights. The results are organized into respective directories based on the dataset analyzed:

- **goodreads/**:  
  Outputs related to the Goodreads dataset.  
  Contains:
  - **Top 2 Variable Histograms**: Visualizes the distribution of the two most variable numerical columns.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays relationships between all numerical columns.
  - **README.md**:story narrated from goodreads.csv data.

- **happiness/**:  
  Outputs related to the Happiness dataset.  
  Contains:
  - **Top 2 Variable Histograms**: Visualizes the distribution of the two most variable numerical columns.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays relationships between all numerical columns.
  - **README.md**:story narrated from happiness.csv data.

- **media/**:  
  Outputs related to the Media dataset.  
  Contains:
  - **Top 2 Variable Histograms**: Visualizes the distribution of the two most variable numerical columns.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays relationships between all numerical columns.
  - **README.md**:story narrated from media.csv data.
